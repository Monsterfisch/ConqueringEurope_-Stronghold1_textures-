A winter-themed Stronghold 1 based texture edit for the Christmas time.

As it was a rather quick edit you can expect some oddities here and there. I do NOT plan to edit those on large scale anytime soon but if anyone wants to try their hands on refining the edits, you can feel free to create pull requests to update it.

Have a merry blessed bloody snowball besieging.
